# banking_customer_segmentation
A clustering algorithm to segment banking customers with Portuguese Banking Data

In today's data-driven world, organizations across various industries are increasingly recogniz-ing the significance of customer segmentation in understanding their clientele and tailoring services and marketing campaigns to meet their specific needs. As a data enthusiast with a passion for unlocking insights from complex datasets, I embarked on a personal research pro-ject aimed at leveraging the power of data analytics to conduct customer segmentation within the banking industry. 

The reason I chose the banking industry is related to my previous professional experience, where I completed an internship at a bank in China. During my time there, I conducted research on a particular client group within the retail banking clients, those who are 18 to 35 years old. This client group was selected because their level of engagement with the bank was signifi-cantly lower compared to clients from other age groups. One of the most important insights I generated from my research was that these younger generation clients have very different preferences with regards to types of services and channel of engagement. However, the bank had very few targeted marketing campaigns. This resulted in a level of engagement that is be-low industry average. These findings led me to understand the importance of customer seg-mentation and how it allows businesses to cater to the different preferences from different customers.

The main purpose of this project is to segment the customers of this banking institution and gain a comprehensive understanding of these customer groups. I seek to reveal the distinct characteristics of each customer group to facilitate more customized marketing. Ultimately, I aim to improve the overall effectiveness of the marketing campaign of this bank.
